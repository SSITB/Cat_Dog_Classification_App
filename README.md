## Usage:-
- Download this repository via GIT or zip.
- Generate & save model file from using this `Animal_Classification.ipynb' file.
- `cat_dog_classification_GUI.py` is the GUI App, just you have to load the images of Cat & Dog from `test_images` folder. It can predict the which animal is this.
- I used SVM for it, Accuracy is lower but this one is only for tutorial purpose.
